# Topic-Modeling

## Description
Topic modeling uses an unsupervised machine learning method to scan a collection of documents, identify word and phrase patterns within them, and then automatically arrange words and expressions that best describe the collection. In this project I have illustrated an example of the same. This repository contains two Python scripts for topic modeling on text datasets. These scripts are designed to process and analyze large volumes of text, unveiling the underlying thematic structure.

### Files Included
1. `Topic Modeling.ipynb`
   - Topic modeling example to illustrate the whole idea about the topic. 
2. `LDA-2.ipynb`
    - Implements topic modeling using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python Libraries: numpy, pandas, sklearn, gensim

Install the prerequisites using the command:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas sklearn gensim
```

## Usage 
1. `Topic Modeling.ipynb`
    ```bash
    python Topic Modeling.ipynb
    ```
2. `LDA-2.ipynb`
    ```bash
    LDA-2.ipynb
    ```
